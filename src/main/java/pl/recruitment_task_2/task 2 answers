The main problem I see when working with this table is its size. I would try to split the data into several smaller tables to speed up data retrieval.
2b
I was taught in the course that a better way to use varchar than char is because it uses less memory, so I would probably consider changing the char columns to varchar.

An index is a collection of key-location values and can be compared to a table of contents in books. It is used to optimize database searches.
When creating the index, consider how often we search by a given column, whether the columns follow the word WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, whether the columns are foreign keys or unique keys.
Looking at frequently searched data, I would create indexes on the columns city, country, RV, price because it will be the most searched data.

Foreign keys are columns used to connect between tables in a database. Their main purpose is to enforce referential integrity and improve performance because are automatically indexed.
Foreign keys should not be used if the data types in the joining columns are not the same.
I would use foreign keys in this case as I wrote in task 2a because the big problem is the size of the table. Breaking the table into several smaller ones would help optimize the search performance,
but these tables need to be linked in some way, and a great way to do this is with foreign keys. Searching for data in smaller tables is faster, thanks to automatic indexing of foreign keys.
